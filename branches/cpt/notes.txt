		- defined in file PolyLine.h and implemented in file PolyLine.cpp
		- represents an open or closed polyline (a closed polyline is a polygon)
		- contains arrays of corner positions and side-styles, where a side-style 
			may be a straight line or a clockwise or counterclockwise arc
		- a closed polyline may contain multiple contours, where the first contour 
			is the external outline and subsequent contours represent "holes"

		- contains a pointer to the CShape object of its footprint
		- contains positioning and status information required for drawing
		- contains an array of part_pins (one for each pin)
		- each padstack contains a pointer to the net attached to that pin
			
	CPartList:
		- common name "part list"
		- defined in file PartList.h, implemented in file PartList.cpp 
		- this contains all of the cparts in the design
		- it is implemented as a linked lists of cparts
		- cparts in the part list are drawn by adding their graphic
			elements to the display list, which handles all drawing to the layout
			area of the application window (see below)
		- since many of the operations on parts require access to the netlist,
			it contains a pointer to the CNetList object for the project
			
	cpin:
		- common name "pin" or "net pin"
		- defined in file NetList.h, implemented if file NetList.cpp
		- represents a single pin in a net

		- represent a single copper area attached to a net
		- contains a CPolyLine which actually defines the area
		- contains an array of indexes into the pin array for the cnet,
			defining all of the pins that connect to it

	cnet:
		- common name "net"
		- defined in file NetList.h, implemented if file NetList.cpp
		- represents a single net
		- identified by a name, which is a unique string such as "GND"
		- contains an array of pins, where each pin has a part ref and a pin number,
			such as "U23.6" for pin 6 of part U23
		- each pin includes a pointer to the part for that pin
		- contains an array of cconnects that define connections between pins
		- contains an array of copper areas

	CNetList:
		- common name "net list"
		- defined in file NetList.h, implemented in NetList.cpp
		- this is a map of all of the nets in a design
		- since many of the operations on nets require access to the part list,
			it contains a pointer to the CPartList object for the project

	dl_element:
		- common name "graphic element"
		- defined in file CDisplayList.h
		- this is a structure which describes a primitive graphic element such
			as a line, rectangle, circle, etc.
		- all drawing into the layout area of the window consists of these
			elements, which are placed into a display list (see below)
		- each element is assigned to a drawing layer (such as TOP_SILKSCREEN, etc.)

	CDisplayList:
		- common name "display list"
		- defined in file DisplayList.h, implemented in file DisplayList.cpp 
		- this is a linked list of graphic elements which make up the PCB drawing
		- each element is identified by the id of the item that it represents
		- an item may be erased from the screen by removing all of the 
			graphic elements from the display list which have the item's id,
			then redrawing


Some examples of information flow:

	- when starting the application:
		- a CDisplayList is created
		- a CPartList is created
		- a CNetList is created
		- pointers to the CDisplayList and CNetList are passed to the CPartList
		- pointers to the CDisplayList and CPartList are passed to the CNetList
			
	- when opening a project:
		- the project file is read
		- all cparts are added to the CPartList (see below) 
		- all cnets are added to the CNetList (see below)
			
	- when adding a part:
		- a cpart is created
		- if the footprint of the part doesn't already exist in the design, it is
			imported from a library and a CShape created
		- a pointer to the CShape is passed to the cpart
		- the cpart is added to CPartList
		- CPartList draws the part by adding its graphic elements to the display list
		- each graphic element is identified by the id of the part
		- CDisplayList draws the graphic elements on the screen, thereby drawing the
			part
		- graphic elements drawn to the SELECTION layer are usually invisible, and
			are used for selecting parts (see below)

	- when the user selects a part by clicking the mouse button:
		- the cursor position is passed to CDisplayList::TestSelect(), which searches 
			for a corresponding graphic element on the SELECTION layer (these 
			elements will generally be invisible)
		- if a graphic element is found at the cursor position, its id is passed back
			to the calling program which can use it to identify the item represented
			by the graphic element
 
 

CPT revisions:
1. m_active_width added to CFreePcbView.  Permits adjustment
    of width during routing.  There are coordinated changes in the system of via widths.  
2. Got rid of the OPENFILENAME_SIZE_VERSION_400 business in calls to 
	CFileDialog::CFileDialog().  (Produced "Assertion failed" errors, at least under Visual studio 10.)
2a. In CUR_END_VTX_SELECTED mode, changed the
    original assignment of F2 when the vertex is a via (was FK_ADD_SEGMENT, now FK_VIA_SIZE)
3. Shortcut keys: Ctrl F1..., Ctrl 1..., Alt 1...  NB undo is now ctrl-shift-z (ctrl-y would toggle layer #13 or some such)
4. Changed shift-key and ctrl-key state detection.
5. Tools>Preferences.  Starting to move some config elements to the Registry (desirable?)
6. Since MS broke CFileDialog::SetTemplates(), changed the import netlist and export netlist options dialogs.
7. Moved strings into Resource string table.
8. Allowed adaptible widths for items in MyToolBar, the left pane, and the F-key
	help boxes.  (For use by people doing foreign language adaptations with Resource Hacker)
9. Added a project folder selection button to DlgProjectOptions
10.  Altered DlgLayers.  Now allows for control of the colors in the FootprintView (they match the main view colors, 
	except for the layers that are footprint-specific --- those latter get extra rows in the DlgLayers table).  Allowed
	for setting a color scheme to be used by default in future projects (vals stored in the registry).
11. Fixed bugs with the display of new (empty) documents.
12. Added reference-text-visibility control to DlgAddPart.  Fixed bug where ref text visibility came out randomly when
	copying and pasting.
13. "/" key for toggle units.  "?" for toggle units plus change grid units.  Tweaked FreePcbView::OnChangeUnits().
14. New system for modifying grid values (View>Visible Grid Values, etc.).  Completed conversion over from 
	default.cfg to the registry for all program-wide prefs (for new projects e.g.).  Added checkbox to Project>Options
	to make settings default.  Moved some stuff to Tools>Preferences.

...TortoiseSVN commit by Allan, revision 238

14a. Info related to default new-project settings _no longer_ in the registry, but stored in default.cfg.
15. Modified group-selection behavior, so that there is no longer a distinction between a group of 1 element and a single selected
	item.  To prevent any lost functionality, implemented arrow keys for board edges, area edges, sm-cutouts, and end-vertices; implemented
	ctrl-c/x for single selected items.
16. Added sorting to export netlist.
17. Removed restriction on pin names (before, 1A and A1A were illegal)
18. During connect-to-pin-to-create-ratline mode (CUR_DRAG_CONNECT), the status bar now shows the name of the pin where mouse is hovering.
19. After creating such a ratline, it is selected by default.
20. When moving groups/parts, don't unroute an adjacent seg if, say, the group is moving vertically and the seg is vertical (changes in e.g.
   	CNetList::UnrouteSegment() and CNetList::UnrouteSegmentWithoutMerge())
21. When routing a ratline provide highlighting for the opposite end of the ratline
22. Tweaked behavior of ctrl-up/dn (they now change whichever grid is currently relevant --- routing grid if net object is selected, placement
     grid otherwise).  Alt-up/dn now controls the visible grid.
23. Made a start towards ratline elimination in case the ratline's two endpoints are already connected by some sort of copper route
     (including connects and/or areas).  Can't yet create traces where neither end is a pin (see TestC.fpc for an example where this would be
	 nice).
24. Suppressed DRC width errors for segments in the ratline layer.
25. Fixed bug with random ref text visibility after importing netlists.

...TortoiseSVN commit, version 244

25a. Fix 25 (random ref text visibility after importing netlist bug) didn't quite do it;  bug should now be smashed!
26. Fixed bug where SetFKText wasn't reliably called when starting up the footprint editor (see CFootprintView constructor)
27. obparham's idea: boxes for grabbing vertices are no longer a constant size in mils (in pixel terms, they are a minimum of 6 pixels wide/high
	and a maximum of 16 pixels wide/high).
28. Bug fix in ReadFileLines() (FreePcbDoc.cpp) (related to feature #14a).
29. Fixed bug in feature #20 (wasn't implemented when moving parts with the mouse).
30. Created CPartList::CheckBrokenArea():  checks if an area has been broken, or nearly broken, by clearances for traces from other nets.  TODO: 
	make it accommodate areas with curved edges.
31.  THE BIGGIE:  created class CCommonView as a base for CFootprintView and CFreePcbView.  Moved shared functions into it.  Added functionality to
	footprint editor to make it more consistent with the main editor, including:  selection masks; hotkeys for layers and masks;
	arrow keys with dx/dy status display;  status bar when pin & outline-corner selected has become more informative (shows x/y);  
	status bar shows dx/dy when dragging pins, text, ref-text, etc.
32. Reworked the internal handling of the ref-text and value-text objects in footprint editor.  They are now basically instances of CText, 
	meaning we can rely on that class's preexisting functions and eliminate some more-or-less-duplicate code.
33. Modified behavior of CFootprintView::OnViewEntireFootprint() to account better for ref and value text.

...TortoiseSVN commit, version 246

34. Resolved apparent bug in CNetList::ClipAreaPolygon() (a commented-out "if"-clause, now restored).  Was causing insertion of corner into area
	edges to fail if new vertex was collinear with pre-existing vertices.
35. Continuation of #30: CPartList::CheckBrokenArea() now accounts for curved area edges.

...TortoiseSVN commit, version 247

36. Added left-handed mode support (reverses function keys).   Activate it via Tools>Preferences.
37. Fixed CText constructor (dl_sel member wasn't prveviously initialized).  Caused problems when one called CShape::m_value->Undraw()
	in cases where CShape::m_value->Draw() hadn't previously been called (because CShape::m_value_size was 0, say)
38. A little clean-up for CShape::CreateMetaFile() & CreateWarningMetaFile() (evidently pretty old code).
39. (Basically a continuation of #33 earlier.)  Improvements to the new CText::GetBounds().  Before it would fail for text that had 
	never been drawn, implying in turn bogus results from
	FootprintView::OnViewEntireFootprint() when first starting the fp editor.  Also: improved system for initializing the new 
	CShape::m_ref and CShape::m_value.  (Constructor does more of the work, as it should.)
40. In FootprintView, forbade setting ref-text height to 0 --- doing that caused "REF" to shrink down to a useless dot that a later user 
    couldn't select or repair   If users want invisible ref-text, I say they can do it when inserting the part into the board.
	Considered making the same prohibition for value-text, but instead I'm implementing "View>Reveal Value Text" (CFootprintView::OnValueReveal())
	in case user wants to restore a	size-0 "VALUE" (formerly impossible to do short of hacking the fpl file).  
	This supplants the old apparently disused CFootprintView::OnAddValueText() function.
41. Slight change to selection masks in footprint editor.
42. Got ESC key working better in footprint editor.
