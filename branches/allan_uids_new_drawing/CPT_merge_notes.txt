CPT merge notes
---------------
#1	- merged
#2	- merged
#2a	- deferred, since I've started to combine property dialogs, so all properties 
	of an item are accessed from a single dialog using F1, leaving F2 available		
#3  - merged 
#4  - merged
#5  - deferred, since I think this was changed later
#6  - deferred, since I'm not seeing the problem with SetTemplates()
#7  - merged
#8  - merged
#9  - merged new Project Options dialog, but this doesn't have the items that were later moved 
	to Tools->Options
#13 - merged

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CPT revisions:
1. m_active_width added to CFreePcbView.  Permits adjustment
    of width during routing.  There are coordinated changes in the system of via widths.  
2. Got rid of the OPENFILENAME_SIZE_VERSION_400 business in calls to 
	CFileDialog::CFileDialog().  (Produced "Assertion failed" errors, at least under Visual studio 10.)
2a. In CUR_END_VTX_SELECTED mode, changed the
    original assignment of F2 when the vertex is a via (was FK_ADD_SEGMENT, now FK_VIA_SIZE)
3. Shortcut keys: Ctrl F1..., Ctrl 1..., Alt 1...  NB undo is now ctrl-shift-z (ctrl-y would toggle layer #13 or some such)
4. Changed shift-key and ctrl-key state detection.
5. Tools>Preferences.  Starting to move some config elements to the Registry (desirable?)
6. Since MS broke CFileDialog::SetTemplates(), changed the import netlist and export netlist options dialogs.
7. Moved strings into Resource string table.
8. Allowed adaptible widths for items in MyToolBar, the left pane, and the F-key
	help boxes.  (For use by people doing foreign language adaptations with Resource Hacker)
9. Added a project folder selection button to DlgProjectOptions
10.  Altered DlgLayers.  Now allows for control of the colors in the FootprintView (they match the main view colors, 
	except for the layers that are footprint-specific --- those latter get extra rows in the DlgLayers table).  Allowed
	for setting a color scheme to be used by default in future projects (vals stored in the registry).
11. Fixed bugs with the display of new (empty) documents.
12. Added reference-text-visibility control to DlgAddPart.  Fixed bug where ref text visibility came out randomly when
	copying and pasting.
13. "/" key for toggle units.  "?" for toggle units plus change grid units.  Tweaked FreePcbView::OnChangeUnits().
14. New system for modifying grid values (View>Visible Grid Values, etc.).  Completed conversion over from 
	default.cfg to the registry for all program-wide prefs (for new projects e.g.).  Added checkbox to Project>Options
	to make settings default.  Moved some stuff to Tools>Preferences.

14a. Info related to default new-project settings _no longer_ in the registry, but stored in default.cfg.
15. Modified group-selection behavior, so that there is no longer a distinction between a group of 1 element and a single selected
	item.  To prevent any lost functionality, implemented arrow keys for board edges, area edges, sm-cutouts, and end-vertices; implemented
	ctrl-c/x for single selected items.
16. Added sorting to export netlist.
17. Removed restriction on pin names (before, 1A and A1A were illegal)
18. During connect-to-pin-to-create-ratline mode (CUR_DRAG_CONNECT), the status bar now shows the name of the pin where mouse is hovering.
19. After creating such a ratline, it is selected by default.
20. When moving groups/parts, don't unroute an adjacent seg if, say, the group is moving vertically and the seg is vertical (changes in e.g.
   	CNetList::UnrouteSegment() and CNetList::UnrouteSegmentWithoutMerge())
21. When routing a ratline provide highlighting for the opposite end of the ratline
22. Tweaked behavior of ctrl-up/dn (they now change whichever grid is currently relevant --- routing grid if net object is selected, placement
     grid otherwise).  Alt-up/dn now controls the visible grid.
23. Made a start towards ratline elimination in case the ratline's two endpoints are already connected by some sort of copper route
     (including connects and/or areas).  Can't yet create traces where neither end is a pin (see TestC.fpc for an example where this would be
	 nice).
24. Suppressed DRC width errors for segments in the ratline layer.
25. Fixed bug with random ref text visibility after importing netlists.

...TortoiseSVN commit, version 244

25a. Fix 25 (random ref text visibility after importing netlist bug) didn't quite do it;  bug should now be smashed!
26. Fixed bug where SetFKText wasn't reliably called when starting up the footprint editor (see CFootprintView constructor)
27. obparham's idea: boxes for grabbing vertices are no longer a constant size in mils (in pixel terms, they are a minimum of 6 pixels wide/high
	and a maximum of 16 pixels wide/high).
28. Bug fix in ReadFileLines() (FreePcbDoc.cpp) (related to feature #14a).
29. Fixed bug in feature #20 (wasn't implemented when moving parts with the mouse).
30. Created CPartList::CheckBrokenArea():  checks if an area has been broken, or nearly broken, by clearances for traces from other nets.  TODO: 
	make it accommodate areas with curved edges.
31.  THE BIGGIE:  created class CCommonView as a base for CFootprintView and CFreePcbView.  Moved shared functions into it.  Added functionality to
	footprint editor to make it more consistent with the main editor, including:  selection masks; hotkeys for layers and masks;
	arrow keys with dx/dy status display;  status bar when pin & outline-corner selected has become more informative (shows x/y);  
	status bar shows dx/dy when dragging pins, text, ref-text, etc.
32. Reworked the internal handling of the ref-text and value-text objects in footprint editor.  They are now basically instances of CText, 
	meaning we can rely on that class's preexisting functions and eliminate some more-or-less-duplicate code.
33. Modified behavior of CFootprintView::OnViewEntireFootprint() to account better for ref and value text.

...TortoiseSVN commit, version 246

34. Resolved apparent bug in CNetList::ClipAreaPolygon() (a commented-out "if"-clause, now restored).  Was causing insertion of corner into area
	edges to fail if new vertex was collinear with pre-existing vertices.
35. Continuation of #30: CPartList::CheckBrokenArea() now accounts for curved area edges.

...TortoiseSVN commit, version 247

36. Added left-handed mode support (reverses function keys).   Activate it via Tools>Preferences.
37. Fixed CText constructor (dl_sel member wasn't prveviously initialized).  Caused problems when one called CShape::m_value->Undraw()
	in cases where CShape::m_value->Draw() hadn't previously been called (because CShape::m_value_size was 0, say)
38. A little clean-up for CShape::CreateMetaFile() & CreateWarningMetaFile() (evidently pretty old code).
39. (Basically a continuation of #33 earlier.)  Improvements to the new CText::GetBounds().  Before it would fail for text that had 
	never been drawn, implying in turn bogus results from
	FootprintView::OnViewEntireFootprint() when first starting the fp editor.  Also: improved system for initializing the new 
	CShape::m_ref and CShape::m_value.  (Constructor does more of the work, as it should.)
40. In FootprintView, forbade setting ref-text height to 0 --- doing that caused "REF" to shrink down to a useless dot that a later user 
    couldn't select or repair   If users want invisible ref-text, I say they can do it when inserting the part into the board.
	Considered making the same prohibition for value-text, but instead I'm implementing "View>Reveal Value Text" (CFootprintView::OnValueReveal())
	in case user wants to restore a	size-0 "VALUE" (formerly impossible to do short of hacking the fpl file).  
	This supplants the old apparently disused CFootprintView::OnAddValueText() function.
41. Slight change to selection masks in footprint editor.
42. Got ESC key working better in footprint editor.

...TortoiseSVN commit, version 248

43.  Fixed 'N' key so that it selects a net if a ratline was previously selected.  Also turned 'N' into a toggle key, so that pressing it twice takes 
	us back to the prior selection.
44.  Similar changes for 'T' (which selects individual traces)
45. New system for selecting.  (See CDisplayList::TestSelect(), and the new CCommonView::m_sel_offset.)  If user repeatedly clicks on a spot where 
	multiple objects are located, the selection cycles through all of them.  Ctrl-click in the main CFreePcbView is also affected:  if you ctrl-click 
	a spot in order to select or unselect a group member, and don't get the effect you want, keep holding ctrl and clicking until you do.
46. Improved TestLineHit() in utility.cpp so that we get more reliable results (on short segments particularly).
